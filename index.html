                                    Welcome to my introduction! First, thank you for visiting my page and taking the time to learn more about me. I'm Connie Keum, and I'm excited to share my story with you. <br /> <br />

                                    First off, I have a deep passion for life. I believe that everything we do should be approached with passion, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn. That's why I'm always eager to take on new challenges and embrace the journey ahead.  <br /> <br />

                                    To help me understand where I am on this journey, I always ask myself three questions: What am I good at? What do I like? What do I want to do in the future? These answers have always been evolving and will continue to change, but one thing remains constant: my love for innovation. <br /> <br />
                                    
                                    Innovating towards a better world is my goal, and I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact. I enjoy analyzing problems, searching for solutions, and bringing big and small innovations to the world. My definition of a better world is one where the majority's inconveniences are resolved. <br /> <br />

                                    To achieve this goal, I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and gain new experiences. Currently, I'm strengthening my understanding of data analysis and working in the business development team at Henkel as  Korea Adhesives business marketing lead. I'm committed to continuing my efforts to deepen my perspective and gain more knowledge. <br /> <br />

                                    My experiences have taught me valuable lessons about adaptability and understanding different cultures. During my internship at Henkel, I learned how to adapt to a new field and understand the electronics market. Studying different studies at various universities has helped me to broaden my perspective and gain deeper insights into different cultures. <br /> <br />

                                    I'm excited about contributing my skills and knowledge to more professional areas and continuing my journey towards innovation. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I look forward to connecting with you soon. <br /> <br />

                                            HUFS (Hankuk University of Foreign Studies) is a specialized university for foreign languages and offers various programs for international students. While I was leading the Buddy program at the International Student Organization (ISO), I noticed that some Korean students dropped out because the foreign student's native language wasn't their desired language to learn. To address this issue, I launched a language exchange program called 'GAT (Give and Take)' with the school's approval. The program focused on one-on-one matching based on the participants' language preferences and learning styles. Out of 500 applicants, we selected 200 participants, and the program was a success, becoming an official and representative program of the school. My experience of solving this problem helped me improve my problem-solving and practical skills before entering my professional career.
