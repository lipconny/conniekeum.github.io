                                <p>Hello, first of all, I would like to say thank you for visiting this page. <br /> <br />
                                    Before I introduce myself to you, I asked myself endless questions and thought about how to introduce myself to people who are seeing me for the first time or who already know me.
                                    To begin with, I decided not to stop defining myself. Rather, I'm going to explore myself endlessly than limit myself to few simple words. Life is the passion for me. It's my life to put passion into everything given, challenge, and learn, and I enjoy and love the process. That's why I'm curious and look forward to the upcoming future. I always ask three questions to myself. <br /> <br />
                                    <b>
                                    What am I good at? <br />
                                    What do I like? <br /> </b>
                                    The last question to combine the first two questions is, <b>what do I want to do in the future?</b><br /> <br />
                                    The answers to these questions have always changed, are changing, and will change. I would answer these three questions by saying that I love constantly challenging myself to new things, and I am good at learning quickly and blending myself into the new environment, and therefore I want to continue to experience new things in the future. <br /><br />
                                    Therefore, I am currently conducting market research and sales coordination in the electronic materials business department, which is not related to my major and has no experience before. It is interesting to study, present, and learn from experts about markets for electronic devices such as semiconductors, modules, and smartphones(and so on) every day. At first, I had a hard time due to a lack of confidence from my inexperience in new fields, but after studying more and learning hard by attending meetings and reading lots of business reports, I am confident with the work I am doing. This amazing experience has grown into a solid power of confidence in me. I acquired a strong belief that I can work hard and achieve confidently, no matter what new mission is given to me.<br /> <br /> 
                                    Now, I would like to introduce my answers in the past to my questions. In the past, I loved to experience different cultures and was good at understanding the difference between culture and social groups. My life has been on the extension of attempts to learn and experience different cultures. I started this experience by growing up in London. Since I could go through various cultural backgrounds in London, I had a strong desire to learn other cultures and languages, so I studied Japanese in my middle school, French for three years in high school. In high school, I forced myself to experience diverse cultures and relations by participating in the Model UN and debating team. <br /><br />
                                    Studying English Literature and French/European Studies helped me expanding my perspective and gaining deeper insight into understanding different cultures. For studying deeper, I went to King’s College London for summer school and I was deeply impressed by different ideas during the class discussion about the various issues like feminism or social hierarchy by studying film studies. As an extension of the experience that I built up in KCL, I conducted further studies in the Social Science field at Universiteit Leiden. Studying in different universities through the exchanging programs was a gateway to a great opportunity to make new friends from a different country, learn from different professors, and so much more.<br /><br />
                                    To understand the view of foreigners and help foreign students who visit Korea, I worked in the ISO(International Student Organization) at my university for 3 years as a team leader and president. Communicating with them and knowing their needs, I planned the language exchange program by myself and made it an official program at our university. <br /><br />
                                    Based on the leadership and problem-solving skills that I earned from the experience in ISO, I started participating in programs that can change our society. I always thought the Korean educational system for high school students has a problem in building self-esteem, so I joined the Policy Development Project Team as a team leader. This program was awarded for proving the possibility of a better world in the process of the 2017 Youth Innovator Training Course 'Betterworldschool@Seoul' by Seoul Metropolitan. As an extension, I participated as the representative of Korea and the interpreter for descendants of French veterans in the United Nation Peace camp. It was a precious moment for me to become acquainted with the contributions, appreciate the sacrifice and contributions of the United Nations Forces in the Korean War, and moreover, maintain positivities with third and fourth generation family members. <br /><br />
                                    Combining all the knowledge that I absorbed in all different kinds of studies in the different educational institutions all over the world and extracurricular experiences, now I want to contribute to more professional areas.</p>

While I was participating in ISO as a Buddy program leader, I found that the program wasn't successful because of the Korean student who gave up the Buddy program since the foreign student's native language wasn't the target language that they wanted to learn.</p>
                                    <p>Based on what I observed, I planned and carried out the project to improve the problem. I planned a program that focuses only on language exchange and launched an official project team named 'GAT(Give And Take)' with the approval of the school after presenting the idea as a team leader. With the vision of 'one-on-one matching, Regarding your preference for language and learning style', out of the total of over 500 applicants, 200 were selected and conducted as participants, and as a result, now it was established as an official and representative program of the school. Before I became a full-fledged member of a professional area, my experience of solving the problems of school, which was like a small society for me, helped me improve my ability to solve problems and practice.</p> </i>
