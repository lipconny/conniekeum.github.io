                                <p>My life has been on the extension of attempts to learn and experience different cultures. I started this experience by growing up in London. Since I could go through various cultural backgrounds in London, I had a strong desire to learn other cultures and languages, so I studied Japanese in my middle school, French for three years in high school. In high school, I forced myself to experience diverse cultures and relations by participating in the Model UN and debating team. </p>
                                <p>Studying English Literature and French/European Studies helped me expanding my perspective and gaining deeper insight into understanding different cultures. For studying deeper, I went to King’s College London for summer school and I was impressed by different ideas during the class discussion about the various issues like feminism or social hierarchy by studying film studies. As an extension of the experience that I built up in KCL, I conducted further studies in the Social Science field at Universiteit Leiden. Studying in different universities through the exchanging programs was a gateway to a great opportunity to make new friends from a different country, learn from different professors, and so much more.</p>
                                <p>To understand the view of foreigners and help foreign students who visit Korea, I worked in the ISO(International Student Organization) at my university for 3 years as a team leader and president. Communicating with them and knowing their needs, I planned the language exchange program by myself and made it an official program at our university.</p>
                                <p>Based on the leadership and problem-solving skills that I earned from the experience in ISO, I started participating in the programs that can actually change our society. I always thought the Korean educational system for high school students has a problem in building self-esteem, so I joined the Policy Development Project Team as a team leader. This program was awarded for proving the possibility of a better world in the process of the 2017 Youth Innovator Training Course 'Betterworldschool@Seoul' by Seoul Metropolitan. As an extension, I participated as the representative of Korea and the interpreter for descendants of French veterans in the United Nation Peace camp. It was a precious moment for me to become acquainted with the contributions, appreciate for the sacrifice and contributions of the United Nations Forces in the Korean War, and moreover, to maintain positivities with third and fourth generation family members.</p>
                                <p>Combining all the knowledge that I absorbed in all different kinds of studies in the different educational institutions all over the world and extracurricular experiences, I want to contribute to more professional areas.</p>

While I was participating in ISO as a Buddy program leader, I found that the program wasn't successful because of the Korean student who gave up the Buddy program since the foreign student's native language wasn't the target language that they wanted to learn.</p>
                                <p>Based on what I observed, I planned and carried out the project to improve the problem. I planned a program that focuses only on language exchange and launched an official project team named 'GAT(Give And Take)' with the approval of the school after presenting the idea as a team leader. With the vision of 'one-on-one matching, Regarding your preference for language and learning style', out of the total of over 500 applicants, 200 were selected and conducted as participants, and as a result, now it was established as an official and representative program of the school. Before I became a full-fledged member of a professional area, my experience of solving the problems of school, which was like a small society for me, helped me improve my ability to solve problems and practice.</p>
